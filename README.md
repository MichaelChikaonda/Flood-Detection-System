In this project, we have a FloodDetectingSystem class with a method detectFlood 
that takes the water level as input and checks if the water level is greater than 100 cm.
If it is, it sets the isFloodDetected flag to true and prints a message indicating that a 
flood has been detected. Otherwise, it sets the flag to false and prints a message indicating 
that no flood has been detected. The main method demonstrates how to use the FloodDetectingSystem
class by creating an instance of it and calling the detectFlood method with different water levels
